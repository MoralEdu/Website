    <h1>What exactly are human needs?</h1>
    <div class="statement">
      <h2>Some examples of human needs are:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Safety needs</li>
        <li>Physiological needs</li>
        <li>Esteem</li>
        <li>Self actualisation</li>
        <li>Love and belonging</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>These are called the Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs.</h2>
      
      <h2>But on the other hand, you should know some examples of 'wants' ehich are:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Electronics</li>
        <li>Entertainment</li>
        <li>Vehichles</li>
        <li>Holidays</li>
        <li>Materialistic items (e.g. luxury goods)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Some of these can be debated as the world progresses. An example of this was the use of face masks during the Covid-19 
        pandemic in which masks were needed to contain the spread but pre pandemic, very few people actually needed them.</h2>
