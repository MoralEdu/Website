    <h1>How can we implement these values in our lives?</h1>
    <div class="statement">
      <h2>You can implement these values in life by doing something as little as giving those 
        less fortunate than us a worker a bottle of water. It may mean nothing to us but it 
        could make their day.</h2>
      
      <h2>Other ways are:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Donating to charities</li>
        <li>Volunteering</li>
        <li>Helping your community</li>
        <li>Donating to a food bank</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Another way we have tried to help is the promotion of the UNICEF charity. Their goal is to 
        provide the less fortunate with the basic necessities for those who don't have access.</h2>
      
      <h2>Although they have limited funding, we would like to put the spotlight on them in order to raise awareness
        for these amazing causes.</h2>
